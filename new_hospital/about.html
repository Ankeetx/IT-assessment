					The basic purpose of a hospital is to provide care to its patients. Therefore, it is no surprise that the most comprehensive set of policies and procedure manual is the one directed to this department. Such policies cover topics from, nutrition guides, patient and family education, abuse and neglect, admission and discharge, patient call back, patient rights and responsibilities, as well as, numerous other topics. The policies differ for each department as well, for instance, the paediatrics ward would have a separate set of policies as opposed to cardiological ward. <br><br>

					Finally, it is very important how a hospital shares its information. This information can be related to a staff member, patient, or a visitor. It is very important for an organization to ensure everyone is following a strict code of privacy, and is not violating anyoneâ€™s right <br><br>
